# Device Transition & Maintenance Service

This repository provides support for Chromebooks that have transitioned to full private ownership (100% payment completion). 

## 🛡️ Service & Warranty Terms
By utilizing this service, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

- **Independent Support:** This is a private service. Do not take your device to the school IT Support Office or contact the Trust IT helpdesk for any issues related to this software modification.
- **Warranty Status:** Applying this process officially voids the IT Services warranty.
- **Developer Support:** If you encounter software complications, "hangs," or errors, contact the maintainer of this repository directly. I will provide a quote and arrange a price for any necessary software restoration or fixes.

## 🔑 Setup Guide
The process is pre-configured for ease of use. No technical execution is required from the user side other than the following:

1. **Account Handover:** The device is currently configured with a temporary Gmail account.
2. **Personalization:** You are required to swap the temporary Gmail for your own personal Google Account immediately upon receipt.
3. **Connectivity:** The specific Wi-Fi credentials required for the initial handshake will be provided privately upon agreement.

## ⚠️ Liability Notice
The user assumes all responsibility for content accessed once school-level web filtering is removed. This tool is provided "as-is".
